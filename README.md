Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database schema.

```sh
> python manage.py makemigrations
```

__migrate:__ _Responsable for applied/unapplied migrations._
```sh
> python manage.py migrate
```

__sqlmigrate :__ _Displays SQL statements for a migration_
```sh
> python manage.py sqlmigrate [App] [Migration ID]
```
